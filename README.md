# ID Detection and Line Segmentation Project

This repository contains two separate implementations for detecting ID cards and extracting text lines from them. Both approaches aim to solve the problem of ID card detection and information extraction, but they use different methodologies: a **classical computer vision approach** and a **deep learning-based approach**.

## Structure

1. `idDetection_Classical_Approach/` :
    - This folder contains the implementation of the **classical approach** for ID card detection and line segmentation,and **README** file for instructions and how to use.

2. `idDetection_DeepLearning_Approach/`:
    - This folder contains the **deep learning approach**, which leverages two fine-tuned YOLO models to perform ID card detection and text line segmentation,and **README** file for instructions and how to use.

3. `id_Detection_and_Line_Extraction_Report`:
    - A detailed report is included , which describes the methodologies, datasets used, and performance of the classical and the deep learning approaches.

## Setup Instructions

   - git clone https://github.com/marvensherif/ID_Detection_Line_Extraction
   - cd idDetection_Classical_Approach
   - **or**
